Dashboards fail when they focus on charts over decisions. This playbook captures the ritual we used to move three product pods from ad-hoc spreadsheets to shared, high-trust dashboards.

## The Ritual

1. **Friction Interviews** – Capture the questions people ask before building visuals.
2. **Metric Contracts** – Define owners, refresh cadence, and alert thresholds.
3. **Storyboarding** – Build Figma wireframes with annotations, not just charts.
4. **Pilot & Shadowing** – Sit in the meetings where the dashboard is used to observe gaps.
5. **Adoption Review** – Measure usage, actionability, and backlog of improvements.

## Toolchain Notes

- Next.js served the dashboard shell with embedded Grafana panels.
- Mode Analytics handled ad-hoc deep dives linked from each tile.
- HubSpot webhooks and Slack reminders nudged teams when metrics went stale.
