When experiments graduated from notebooks, we needed a pipeline that enforced reviews, reproducibility, and drift monitoring. Vertex AI gave us the scaffoldingâ€”but the guardrails were a team effort.

## Pipeline Highlights

- Terraform provisions Vertex Pipelines, GCS, and Artifact Registry through GitOps.
- GitHub Actions runs unit tests, style checks, and triggers pipeline updates per branch.
- Model Registry promotions require signed-off evaluations and drift thresholds.
- BigQuery + Dataform produce monitoring tables that feed Grafana and PagerDuty.

## Results

Model deployments dropped from quarterly to weekly without sacrificing reliability. Stakeholders can trace every experiment from prototype to production in under five clicks.
